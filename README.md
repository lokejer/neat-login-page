This is a sleek, modern login form as preparation for my FED (Frontend Development) CA2 Assignment coming after the June holidays.
I utilised CSS @property to create a neat gradient border effect.

Implemented the Bootstrap framework into the newly-created index.html (home page). Aiming to edit my login.html page to use Bootstrap to minimise CSS
Built an accompanying home page with a hero section, image carousel and FAQ. Fully-responsive.

to-do:
- auto-rotate image carousel using JS
- create register page
- make a backend where peoplee can actually register and login
- add fade-in animations on scroll
- add real google reCAPTCHA
- make the rocket animated (rotate and spin, mimicking "take-off")
